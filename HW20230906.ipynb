        "   ***  - Exercise #1: If someone gets a positive test, is it \"statistically significant\" at the p<0.05 level? Why or why not?in a population of 1000 people, with 5% false positives and no false negatives, with 40% of the population being truly infected we get the following numbers: 0.4 * 1000 = 400 people truly positive (1-0.4) * 1000 = 600 truly negative. However, with a false-positive rate of 5%, 5% of those 600 negative will be considered false positive 0.05 * 600 = 30 out of 600 false-positive 600-30 = 570 diagnosed as negative correctly. So, in this given population, there are 400 positive people in addition to 30 more diagnosed as positive (false-positive). True positive probability would be 400 out of (400+30) all positive = 400/430 = 93% confidence of being TRULY positive. This means that the probability of them being incorrect (or false-positive) is 100%-93% = 7% which suggests a p= 0.07 -> so this would not be considered \"statistically significant\".\n",
