Assume that there are 10 quanta available in a nerve terminal, and for a given release event each is released with a probability of 0.2. For one such event, what is the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 quanta will be released?
# Choose some values for the parameters n and p
p = 0.2 # probability of sucess 
n = 10 # number of quanta available per experiment  
k = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] #make a list of 0 to 10 for quanta
Prob= [] # create an empty list for appending probabiloties for each quantal number
# for loop that goes from k=0 to k=10 and calculate the Binomial probability for each quantal release from 0 to 10
for i in range(0,10):
  k_cur = k[i]
  prob_cur = ((math.factorial(n))/(math.factorial(k_cur)* (math.factorial(n-k_cur)))) * (p**k_cur) * (1-p)**(n-k_cur) 
  Prob.append(prob_cur)
print(Prob)
